# Python GTmetrix API Library
### TODO list
 
 
##### February 4, 2017 -- ssteinerX

1> Exceptions that have default messages shouldn't rep repeat the doc string as the message.  Could use inspect.getdoc or write little decorator.  I know I've done this before, have to find it.

2> Generate docs with Sphinx (NOTE: I don't use .rst, Markdown support hints here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2471804/using-sphinx-with-markdown-instead-of-rst)

3> Publish docs to ReadTheDocs

4> Integrate Tox&Travis @Github
